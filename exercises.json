This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight.</p>\n<p>When lifting it is important to keep the body still so the anterior deltoid is fully utilised; if the weight cannot be lifted by standing still then it is too heavy and a lower weight is needed. It is important to keep a slight bend in the elbow when lifting as keeping the elbow locked will add stress to the elbow joint and could cause injury.</p>\n<p>A neutral grip, similar to that used in the hammer curl, can also be used. With this variation the weight is again raised to eye level, but out to a 45 degree angle from the front of the body. This may be beneficial for those with shoulder injuries, particularly those related to the rotator cuff.</p>",

Lower your body towards the ground while maintaining a straight line from your shoulders to your ankles, and then push back up to the starting position.\n\nUnlike the inclined push-up, the decline push-up places more emphasis on the shoulders and triceps, while still engaging the chest muscles to a lesser extent. By elevating your feet, you increase the difficulty of the exercise by placing more weight on your upper body, forcing your shoulders and triceps to work harder to push your body back up. The decline push-up can be a great way to challenge your upper body strength and improve your ability to perform other push-up variations. As with any exercise, be sure to use proper form and start with a height that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level.",

Lower your body towards the ground while keeping your elbows close to your sides, and then push back up to the starting position.\n\nParallettes push-ups place more emphasis on the chest and shoulders compared to traditional push-ups, as they allow for a greater range of motion in the shoulder joint. This increased range of motion can also help to improve shoulder stability and mobility. Additionally, parallettes push-ups engage the core muscles more than traditional push-ups, as the instability of the parallettes requires greater activation of the core muscles to maintain proper form.\n\nThe added challenge of balancing on the parallettes also requires greater upper body strength and control, making parallettes push-ups a more advanced variation of the traditional push-up. They can be a great way to challenge yourself and add variety to your upper body workout routine. As always, be sure to use proper form and start with a level that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level.",
